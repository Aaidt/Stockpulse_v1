ðŸ“ˆ **Stock Prediction Website**
This project is a stock price prediction web application that uses historical stock data, sentiment analysis, technical indicators, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future stock prices. The app also provides an interactive visualization of stock data, moving averages, sentiment analysis, and future predictions, built with Streamlit.

**Features**
Stock Price Prediction: Predict future stock prices for up to 365 days using an LSTM neural network.
Sentiment Analysis: Fetch and analyze recent news articles using sentiment analysis (VADER) to factor into predictions.
Technical Indicators: Includes Moving Averages (MA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to help analyze stock trends.
Interactive Graphs: Displays trading volume, historical prices, moving averages, and predicted prices with interactive visualizations.
Hover Data: You can view detailed data when hovering over the charts, making the analysis more intuitive.
Technologies Used
Streamlit for the interactive web app.
TensorFlow/Keras for the LSTM model.
YFinance API for fetching historical stock data.
NewsAPI for retrieving recent news articles related to the stock symbol.
VADER Sentiment Analysis (via NLTK) for analyzing news sentiment.
Matplotlib for plotting interactive charts.

Installation
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction-app.git
cd stock-price-prediction-app
2. Create a Virtual Environment
For Windows:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install the dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Add your NewsAPI Key
The app uses the NewsAPI to retrieve relevant news for sentiment analysis. You need to provide your own API key. Update the following line in the code:

python
Copy code
newsapi = NewsApiClient(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE')
You can get your API key from NewsAPI.

5. Run the App
To launch the Streamlit web app, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.

Usage
Enter Stock Symbol: Input the ticker symbol of the stock you want to analyze (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
Set Days to Predict: Enter the number of future days you'd like the model to predict.
View the Results: The app will fetch the data, perform sentiment analysis, and display interactive visualizations and predicted prices.
Interactive Charts
Hover over the charts to see specific data points like price, volume, or sentiment score.
Zoom and pan through the charts for detailed analysis.
Project Structure
bash

â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # List of dependencies

Model Details
The app uses an LSTM neural network to predict future stock prices based on:

Closing prices
Trading volume
Moving Averages (MA10, MA30)
RSI Indicator
Sentiment Analysis from News
How the Sentiment Analysis Works
Sentiment is derived from the most recent 30 days of news articles related to the stock. The VADER sentiment model classifies the news as positive, neutral, or negative, and this sentiment is used as an input feature for the LSTM model.

Example
bash
Copy code
# Sample prediction for Apple (AAPL) stock for 30 days:
Enter stock symbol: AAPL
Enter number of days: 30
The app will display the stock's historical data, trading volume, sentiment analysis, and the predicted stock prices for the next 30 days.
